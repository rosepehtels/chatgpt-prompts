I want to brainstorm a novel idea that is inspired by the Game of Thrones 
series. The prologue will start with Sansa Stark's death and the two main
characters are Arya Stark and Kelvyn, her fiance. Arya is due for marriage 
now that her sister is gone and she is the next in line. Arya isolates 
herself from the world to avoid being married off. Kelvyn has accepted 
the marriage and makes an effort to get Arya to agree. He offers the idea
that they get to know each other to encourage Arya to be more open. I'd like
the main plot to focus on the arranged marriage of Arya and Kelvyn as the Stark
family grieves and accepts the loss of Sansa. In the middle of the story,
we learn something bad about Kelvyn's family and their intentions with this
arrangement. We learn that Kelvyn is involved and because of this, his family
is pressuring Kelvyn to create an heir, specifically one with title. Arya 
has no idea but soon learns of his families intentions and is furious. She
learns that his family just wants an heir and has no intention of actually
welcoming her into his family. Kelvyn however, is interested in learning 
more about Arya and tries to find out as much as he can about her. I would
like her father to make an appearance, but probably not towards the end. 
I would like the story to include elements from the actual series but focus
more on Arya and her life as she navigates life without her sister.
